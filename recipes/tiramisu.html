      <li>
        Cook the egg yolks, sugar, and milk until slightly thickened. Let cool
        slightly, then chill in the fridge for about an hour. When the filling
        has fully chilled, mix in mascarpone cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Beat heavy cream with vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
      <li>
        Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Pour mixture over ladyfingers
        that have been split in half lengthwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line the bottom of a baking dish with soaked ladyfingers. Spread half of
        the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then half of the whipped
        cream over that. Repeat in the same order. Dust with cocoa powder.
